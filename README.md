# Quimera Project

## What is Quimera?
Quimera is an open-source social network I’m building solo, using JavaScript and PHP. The goal is to have a straightforward, modern spot where people can meet, share, and interact. Everything from the code to the design is managed by me, and the project is open for anyone who’s interested in checking it out or helping.

#### Login/Register Page
This is where you start. If you’re new, you can register; if not, just log in. The process is simple and keeps your info safe. The interface is clear, and if you hit any issues, the error messages should help you sort it out.

#### Main Page
After logging in, you’ll see the main page. This is where everything happens—new posts, comments, and what your friends are up to, all get updated in real time. The design is straightforward and easy to get around.

**Features:**
- **Like Button:** Like posts you enjoy. It helps highlight good content.
- **Comment Button (with proper section):** Leave your thoughts or reply to others. Comments stay organized in threads.
- **Save Post Button:** Save posts that you want to come back to later.
- **Vertical Navbar:** Quick links to Home, Profile, Messages, and Settings on the side.
- **Theme Changer:** Switch between different themes, including light and dark.
