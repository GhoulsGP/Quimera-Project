# Quimera Project

## What is Quimera?
Quimera is an open source social network developed solely by me, GhoulsGP, using JavaScript and PHP. The project aims to provide a modern, interactive platform for users to connect, share content, and engage with each other. All development, design, and implementation are managed independently, with a focus on learning, experimentation, and community contribution.

#### Login/Register Page
This is the entry point for new and returning users. The login/register page provides a simple and secure authentication process, ensuring that user data is kept safe. New users can easily create an account, while existing users can log in with their credentials. The UI is designed for ease of use, with clear error messages and guidance to help users access their accounts quickly.

#### Main Page
Once logged in, users are taken to the main page, which serves as the hub for all interactions on Quimera. This page is dynamically updated to show the latest posts, comments, and friend activities. The layout is intuitive, with quick access to all the core features.

**Functionalities:**
- **Like Button:** Allows users to express appreciation for posts. Liking a post helps surface popular content and encourages engagement.
- **Comment Button (with proper section):** Users can leave comments on posts, fostering discussion and community interaction. Comments are displayed in an organized, threaded section for clarity.
- **Save Post Button:** Users can bookmark posts for later viewing, making it easy to keep track of interesting or important content.
- **Vertical Navbar:** The navigation bar on the side provides quick access to all major sections, such as Home, Profile, Messages, and Settings. Its vertical orientation maximizes screen space and improves navigation efficiency.
- **Theme Changer:** Users can switch between light and dark themes, or other available themes, to match their preferences and enhance usability in different environments.
