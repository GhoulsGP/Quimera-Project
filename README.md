# Quimera Project

## What is Quimera?
Quimera is an open source social network developed solely by me, GhoulsGP, using JavaScript and PHP. The project aims to provide a modern, interactive platform for users to connect, share content, and engage with each other. All development, design, and implementation are managed independently, with a focus on learning, experimentation, and community contribution.
